# Made an api called wippy.
Allows users to enter their "work in progress" programming languages.
Access to home route is `/` which should give the message 'Working without errors'
Access to get and post routes is given by the route `/api/wip`

Use curl or hoppscotch to test the get and post requesets.

## Future plans
API (or APY as we like to call it (Python reference, get it??!) has an ID, name and a body as keys. Currently, POST request needs to enter name and body, but in the future, we would like to supply them with a random programming joke (see wireframe below) We would like to work with the [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/), because it has a setting to just give you programming jokes!
